# DevOps Fundamentals

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that aims to unify software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It focuses on collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery to improve the speed, efficiency, and quality of software releases.

### Core Principles of DevOps

- **Collaboration and Communication**:In a DevOps environment, development and operations teams work closely together to breaks down silos that traditionally exist between both teams.
- **Automation**: Automation is at the heart of DevOps.It Streamlines repetitive tasks like testing, integration, and deployment,helping the team not only speeds up the process but also help to reduce the risk of human error.
- **Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD)**: CI/CD ensures rapid, safe, and reliable delivery of changes.
- **Monitoring and Feedback**: Encourages data-driven decisions and rapid issue resolution.
- **Scalability and Reliability**: These supports resilient, scalable infrastructure and applications.

## DevOps Lifecycle Stages

1. **Planning**  
   This is where teams collaborate to define requirements, objectives, and scope before the project starts.

2. **Development**  
   This is where the actual code is written and managed using version control systems, ensuring the teams coordination.

3. **Building**  
   The code is Compiled and converted here into executable applications using automated build tools.

4. **Testing**  
   Testing in DevOps is a continuous process that ensures quality is built into every stage of the software delivery pipeline.

5. **Release**  
   In this phase,the application is prepared for production with versioning and configuration management.

6. **Deployment**  
   This is a process where applications or applicatio updates is deployed to a live environment using continuous deployment tools.

7. **Operations**  
   These focuses on maintaining application performance and availability through system administration and support.

8. **Monitoring**  
   These is a critical phase in the DevOps lifecycle that ensures applications and infrastructure perform optimally in production environments.
